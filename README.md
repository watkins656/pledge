# pledge

I, Dustin Watkins, will take EVERY OPPORTUNITY to advance myself with abandon

Good intentions WILL NOT achieve my goals

Success is NOT what I know, but WHAT I DO with what I know

I EXPECT and WELCOME, the struggle, the learning, the effort, and the growth

I understand that my level of success is determined by my level of commitment

I will ALWAYS FAVOR ACTION over talking, wishing, hoping, and wondering

I WILL ALLOW MYSELF to achieve my dreams

Iâ€™m a FULL-(optional expletive) STACK DEVELOPER!
